## ETL - Tool

This is a demonstration setup for how an ETL is done. It is meant with the aim of exposing the ETL technology that is used in IT companies to college students. 

We are open to contributions. This would greatly help in building an open-source tool that might help college students know more about what is out there in the market.

- Please refer to the [contributor guide](docs/developer-guid.md) for project setup on your local machine.
- Please refer to the [student guide](docs/user-guid.md) on learning more about ETL.



Please check out our pair repository [BriggMap](https://github.com/rajathirumal/BridgeMap) In which we create SQL stored procedures using python like programming language.
